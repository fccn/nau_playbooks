# Openedx deploy role

## Initialize Elasticsearch
To initialize the elasticsearch cluster use the `elasticsearch_initialization` parameter.
Run ansible with `-e openedx_docker_deploy=true -e elasticsearch_initialization=true`.

## Initialize MySQL
To initialize the mysql cluster use the `openedx_mysql_initialization` parameter.
Before run a normal deploy that will stop on the health check steps.

Run ansible with `-e openedx_docker_deploy=true -e openedx_mysql_initialization=true --tags docker_mysql_replication`

## Database Migrations
The database migrations are configured per application using the next ansible extra variables:
- openedx_lms_migrate
- openedx_cms_migrate
- openedx_forum_job_deploy
- openedx_notes_job_deploy
- openedx_discovery_job_deploy
- openedx_insights_job_deploy
- openedx_analyticsapi_migrate
- openedx_ecommerce_job_deploy

Example to run the lms migrations:
```bash
-e openedx_docker_deploy=true -e openedx_lms_migrate=true
```
If you need to run multiple database migrations on multiple containers, then add each variable.
For example to run on lms and studio migrations use:
```bash
-e openedx_docker_deploy=true -e openedx_lms_migrate=true -e openedx_cms_migrate=true
```

## Re-index

To re-index the courses on the new elastic search cluster instance, deploy with this extra ansible parameters:

```bash
-e openedx_docker_deploy=true -e openedx_cms_reindex_all_courses=true
```

To re-index the content library:
```bash
-e openedx_docker_deploy=true -e openedx_cms_reindex_content_library=true
```

To re-index the library you need to run this command directly on the cms container.
```bash
SERVICE_VARIANT=cms python manage.py cms reindex_library --all --settings nau_production
```

To create the index on analytics api:
```bash
-e openedx_analyticsapi_create_elasticsearch_learners_indices=true
```

## Build web server nginx docker image

To build the web server nginx docker image add this extra ansible parameter:
```bash
-e openedx_nginx_build=true
```
If you don't pass this variable it will be used the docker image `nauedu/openedx-nginx:<env>` or other if you change the default variables.

Motivation:

The motivation is to have a rolling deploy and the user don't view any missing asset, like a missing css or logo.

This build will create a docker image based on nginx with current/previous and next release static assets.
The nginx sites will use `try_files` to get the static assets from both next and previous releases.
With this configuration, it's possible to accomplish a rolling deploy of a stack without any perceptive downtime, because the static assets will always load.
